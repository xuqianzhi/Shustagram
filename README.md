Welcome to Shustagram(Shu's Instagram)! I made this application out of my love and appreciation for Instagram! 

# To access Shustagram web app
https://shustagram.herokuapp.com/
You are absolutely welcomed to register your own account and try Shustagram out! (For demo purposes, I have simplified the user signup process, so no email verification is needed at all. Just give it a fake email and you're good to go!) 

Otherwise, you may login using the guest account here:

email: guest@gmail.com

password: hello123

# To access Shustagram iOS app
Requirement: XCode 12
Shustagram is not yet published in the iOS app store. If you have XCode 12, you can simply open Shustagram in the "shustagram-ios" folder and run it in the simulator!

# Main Frameworks and Database used
Sails.js: an MVC framework for Node.js. Sails is adopted for user authentication and its waterline ORM.

Vue.js: a progressive framework for interactive and responsive user interfaces

MongoDB Atlas: used as an external cloud datastore for model and user sessions.

AWS S3: used as external storage for any images(post and user profile).

Shustagram's User Interface is constructed from scratch with pure HTML, CSS, and Swift(for iOS).
